<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, My name is Amadeo, but you can call me Jibs. Too far right? I am an aspiring
  front end developer. I actually liked it back in highschool and now I am trying again
  since a spark came when I came across to a video of someone doing some web development.
</p>

<p>What's is good is that I think I am very much interested to really become one since
  I like to solve problem and really be into work. I hope I can be one as soon as possible.
  I really think programming is so fun like there's life to it. There's satisfaction, stress,
  and that's life where we can experience both ups and downs and be really happy along with it.
